"I feel a bit tired lately",ASK_FOLLOWUP,RETRIEVE_GUIDELINE,False,"Okay  I hear you. It's completely understandable to feel a bit tired sometimes. It can be really draining  and it's okay to acknowledge that.   When I think about it  feeling tired can sometimes be connected to feeling a bit down overall. The system mentioned something called Behavioral Activation  which is just a way to gently nudge you towards doing small things that can help lift your mood  even just a little.   Would you be open to trying something small? Sometimes just getting a little bit of energy back can make a difference. How about this: could you maybe just drink a glass of water? It might not seem like much  but it can be a tiny step.   No pressure at all  but if you're willing  it might be a helpful thing to try. Let me know if you'd like to try that  or if you'd prefer to talk more about how you're feeling. We can explore other small things too!    "
"I've been feeling stressed about work",ASK_FOLLOWUP,RETRIEVE_GUIDELINE,False,"Okay  I hear you. It's completely understandable to feel stressed about work – it's a really common experience. It takes courage to acknowledge that  and I want you to know you're not alone in feeling this way.   Since you mentioned feeling stressed about work  it might be helpful to think about *what* contributes to that stress. We could look at the different factors involved – things you *can* control versus things you can't.   I've got an idea that might help. Let's try something called a Responsibility Pie Chart. It's a way to visually break down what's contributing to your stress. We'll assign percentages to different areas  like:  *   **Things I can control:** (e.g.  my workload  meeting deadlines  how I manage my time  my communication with colleagues) *   **Things I can't control:** (e.g.  company policies  other people's performance  unexpected changes  external factors) *   **Things I *think* I'm responsible for  but might not be:** (e.g.  feeling like I need to please everyone  taking on extra tasks that aren't really my responsibility) *   **Things stemming from my reactions/interpretations:** (e.g.  overthinking situations  catastrophizing  feeling personally attacked)  There's no right or wrong answer here. Just a way to start gaining a clearer picture of where your stress is coming from.   Would you be open to taking a few minutes to start thinking about those categories and assigning percentages to them? It might not solve everything  but it could help us understand the situation a bit better.  No pressure at all  just a gentle exploration.    "
"I have a mild headache today",ASK_FOLLOWUP,RETRIEVE_GUIDELINE,False,"Okay  I hear you. A mild headache can definitely make things feel a little off  and it’s understandable to feel low when you're not feeling your best. It's good that you're acknowledging it.   Since you're dealing with a bit of everything today – feeling low  lack of energy  and the headache – let’s try a small  gentle shift.  My suggestion from earlier is **Behavioral Activation**. Sometimes  even small actions can help nudge us a little bit out of the feeling of being stuck.  Would you be willing to try something really small? How about drinking a glass of water? It’s something simple  and it might help to rehydrate and give you a little bit of a break. No pressure at all  just a tiny step.    Let me know if you decide to try that  or if you’d like to talk about anything else.  Just remember  even small steps forward can make a difference.    "
"I feel anxious before meetings",ASK_FOLLOWUP,RETRIEVE_GUIDELINE,False,"Okay  I hear you. It's completely understandable to feel anxious before meetings – it's a very common feeling! It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of worrying about what might go wrong  and that can definitely make things feel overwhelming.   Let's try a quick technique to help ground you in the present moment and calm your nervous system. This is called Box Breathing. It's a simple way to bring your breath back into focus.  Ready?  Let's start with **inhaling for 4 seconds**. Feel your breath going in... and hold it for **4 seconds**.   Now  **exhale slowly for 4 seconds**. And hold that exhale for **4 seconds**.   Just focus on the counting in your head - 4  4  4  4.   Let's do that one more time... **inhale for 4... hold for 4... exhale for 4... hold for 4.**  How does that feel? Even just a few rounds can make a difference. We can keep practicing if you'd like. Just focus on your breath  and notice how it helps to bring you back to the present.    "
"I haven't been sleeping well",ASK_FOLLOWUP,RETRIEVE_GUIDELINE,False,""I hear you. It sounds incredibly frustrating and exhausting to not be sleeping well. That feeling of worry and restlessness can really take a toll.   Let's try a little something to gently help quiet your mind.  Could you try this with me?  Imagine a series of words  starting with the letter 'A'.  Think of anything that comes to mind – objects  animals  actions... just let the words flow.    Then  as you're thinking of the 'A' words  shift your focus to words starting with the letter 'B'.  Just a simple mental shifting of the alphabet.    It might take a moment  but sometimes this gentle exercise can help to calm the mental chatter a little.  No pressure at all  just see if it helps a tiny bit."    "
"I feel lonely sometimes",ASK_FOLLOWUP,RETRIEVE_GUIDELINE,False,""Oh  I'm so sorry to hear you're feeling lonely sometimes. It's a really tough feeling  and it's completely valid to feel that way. You're definitely not alone in experiencing this.   I understand that sometimes just acknowledging the feeling can be a relief.  And you know what?  We can start with something really small.  It's often easier than we think!    How about we try a 'micro-interaction'? This is just a tiny step to connect with someone.  Could you maybe try saying hello to someone – a neighbor  a cashier at a store  someone you pass on the street?  It doesn't have to be a long conversation  just a simple 'hello'.  No pressure at all  but sometimes a small connection can make a difference.    Just a thought to try.  Let me know how it goes if you feel up to it!"    "
"I feel overwhelmed with school",ASK_FOLLOWUP,RETRIEVE_GUIDELINE,False,"Okay  I hear you. It sounds like you're carrying a lot right now  and feeling overwhelmed with school is completely understandable. It's really brave of you to acknowledge that.   It's okay to feel overwhelmed – it’s a common experience  especially when school feels demanding.  Let’s try something small to help shift your focus just a tiny bit.  Remember  the goal isn't to solve everything at once  just to gently nudge you toward a little bit of feeling a bit more…present.  I've been reminded of something called **Behavioral Activation**. It’s about finding small  manageable things to do  even when you don't feel like it  so it can help boost your mood.   Would you be open to trying just **one tiny task**? It doesn't have to be anything big at all.  Maybe just **drinking a glass of water**?  It's a neutral  basic act  and sometimes just breaking things down into that small step can make a difference.   You don't have to do anything else right now. Just think about that glass of water for a moment. Let me know if you'd like to try that or if you'd prefer to talk more about what's making you feel so overwhelmed.  I'm here to listen.    "
"My throat feels a little sore",ASK_FOLLOWUP,RETRIEVE_GUIDELINE,False,"Okay  I hear you. It sounds like your throat is a little sore. That's definitely uncomfortable.  It's completely understandable that you'd be feeling concerned about that.   And you know  sometimes when we're feeling a little down or stressed (which can sometimes be connected to feeling guilty  even if it's not directly related)  even small physical discomforts can feel amplified.   Let's take a moment to break this down. Sometimes  when we're feeling a lot of things going on inside  it helps to look at all the different factors that might be contributing.  It’s not always about one single thing.  I’m going to suggest something called a "Responsibility Pie Chart." It’s just a way to think about what *might* have contributed to this feeling. It's not about assigning blame  but about acknowledging all the different elements.  Could you maybe think about what could have *potentially* led to your throat feeling sore?  Don't worry about assigning percentages just yet. Just list out  in your own thoughts or maybe even briefly on a piece of paper  *everything* that comes to mind – even if it seems small or insignificant.    For example  maybe it's related to something you ate  something you did  maybe even a stressor you're dealing with.  Just a list of possibilities.  We don't have to solve anything right now. Just brainstorming a list of *potential* factors can sometimes help us gain some perspective.     "
"I feel a little down today",ASK_FOLLOWUP,RETRIEVE_GUIDELINE,False,"Okay  I hear you. It sounds like you're feeling a little down today  and that’s completely valid. It takes courage to acknowledge those feelings.   It's okay to not feel okay. Sometimes  even when we're not feeling our best  we can still take small steps forward.    Based on what you've shared  and the suggestions I mentioned earlier  a tiny  manageable task might help. How about just **drinking a glass of water**? It might seem small  but it can sometimes help re-engage you with the present moment.   No pressure at all  just a little something to try.  Even if you don't feel a difference  you've completed a small act of self-care.   Would you like to try that? Or is there something else  even just a very small thing  that you'd be willing to consider?  Just let me know.    "
"I've been feeling distracted lately",ASK_FOLLOWUP,RETRIEVE_GUIDELINE,False,""It sounds like you're navigating a lot right now  and feeling distracted can be a really common part of that. I hear you saying you've been feeling a little off lately. That's okay. Let's gently ground ourselves in the present moment.  Sometimes  focusing on something physical can help bring us back. How about we try heel-to-toe walking for a few moments? Just focus on the feeling of your heel making contact with the ground  then your toes.  Notice the pressure  the texture of the surface.  We'll just walk slowly  paying close attention to the sensation of each step.    Just let's focus on the feeling of your feet on the ground  okay? We can do this for a minute or two  and then we can see how that feels."    "
"I feel low energy but otherwise okay",ASK_FOLLOWUP,RETRIEVE_GUIDELINE,False,"Okay  thank you for sharing that. It sounds like you're feeling a bit low on energy  and that's completely understandable. It takes courage to acknowledge those feelings.   It's good that you say you're "otherwise okay." That gives us a little more to work with.  Sometimes  even a small shift can make a difference.  Based on what we've discussed  one simple thing we could try is a little **Behavioral Activation**.  It's about gently nudging you toward small  manageable activities.    How about this: **Could you try drinking a glass of water right now?**  Just one glass.  No pressure to feel anything about it  just a small physical act.  It can sometimes help to bring you back to the present moment.

To help gently shift your focus and ground yourself a little bit  let's try something. Can you tell me about something you notice in the room right now?

No pressure to say anything else – just notice what's around you."    "

It's important to remember that you're not alone in feeling this way  and it *will* pass.   The clinical definition mentioned earlier talks about feeling low and lacking energy. Sometimes boredom can be a symptom of a larger feeling of emptiness or hopelessness.   Based on what's been shared  I want to gently suggest a small  achievable step. **Behavioral Activation** is a helpful technique  and it's about finding *something*  no matter how small  to bring a little bit of engagement and a tiny spark of feeling.  How about trying to **drink a glass of water**? It's a simple task  and it can sometimes make a small difference. It won't solve everything  but maybe it'll break up the feeling of being stuck and give you a tiny bit of momentum.   No pressure at all to do anything else right now  just try that one small thing.

Instead of focusing on *why* you're feeling unwell right now  let's take a step back and try to understand the bigger picture. Sometimes  when we're dealing with physical discomfort  it can be easier to get caught up in thoughts that aren't directly related to the feeling  and those thoughts can sometimes trigger feelings of guilt.  Would you be open to something called a "Responsibility Pie Chart"? It's a simple way to think about all the different things that might be contributing to how you're feeling. It doesn't mean you're to blame for anything  just that acknowledging all factors can help us see things more clearly.  Think about this: Is your fever related to anything specific? Maybe something you ate  something you were exposed to  or even something going on in your life that might be adding to your stress?

"I fainted and lost consciousness earlier",ESCALATE,RETRIEVE_GUIDELINE,False,"Oh honey  I am so sorry to hear that you fainted and lost consciousness. That sounds really frightening and upsetting. It's completely understandable to feel shaken up right now.   It's interesting that you mentioned this feeling in connection with your usual feelings of guilt. Sometimes  when we're experiencing something physically difficult like fainting  it can trigger those underlying emotional patterns  even if we don't consciously realize it.   To help process this a little  let's try something. It might bring some clarity. Let's think about everything that might have contributed to what happened. We're not assigning blame *right now*  just trying to understand the different factors.   How about we create a little "Responsibility Pie Chart" together? This is just a way to look at things from different angles  not to judge. We'll assign percentages to different things that might have played a role.    For example  maybe things like:  * **Stress/Overwhelm:** (Could be a big percentage!) * **Physical Factors:** (e.g.  lack of sleep  dehydration  medication) * **Emotional Factors:** (maybe feelings of guilt or anxiety were playing a role?) * **Environmental Factors:** (e.g.  heat  noise)  Just think about what comes to mind when you think about what happened. No pressure to fill in the whole pie right away – even just brainstorming a few things would be helpful. We can take it at your pace.  It’s just a tool to help look at the situation through different lenses.       "
"I am having severe chest pain spreading to my arm",ESCALATE,RETRIEVE_GUIDELINE,False,"Okay  I hear you. That sounds incredibly distressing  and it's completely understandable that you're feeling panicked right now.  It's brave of you to share this.  First  I want you to know that you're not alone  and I'm here to help you focus on the present moment.  It’s okay to feel this way.  Let's try a grounding exercise. This is a technique that can help bring you back to the here and now when you’re feeling overwhelmed.  I'm going to guide you through it step-by-step.  Just focus on the sensations as you do each step.  **5 - See:**  Let's look around you.  Notice five things you can see.  It doesn't have to be anything special – just notice them.  Maybe it's a lamp  a picture on the wall  a book  a chair  or even the color of your clothing.  Just tell me one of each.  **4 - Touch:** Now  let's focus on four things you can physically feel.  Could you feel the texture of your clothes against your skin?  Maybe the chair you're sitting on?  The feeling of your feet on the floor?  Or the feeling of your hands?  Name four things you can touch.  **3 - Hear:** Let's listen for three things you can hear.  It could be the hum of a refrigerator  traffic outside  birds chirping  or your own breathing.  Just focus on the sounds around you  even if they seem faint.  **2 - Smell:**  Now  let’s bring in two things you can smell.  Maybe you can smell your coffee  soap  or something else nearby.  If you don’t smell anything strong  that’s okay – just notice if you can detect two scents.  **1 - Taste:** Finally  let's focus on one thing you can taste.  Do you have anything in your mouth – a piece of gum  toothpaste  or just the lingering taste of something you ate?  Just notice the sensation of the taste.    Take your time with each step.  There's no rush.  Just focus on the sensations.  Let me know when you've completed each step.  We'll go at your pace.    **(Waiting for user response - awaiting confirmation of steps completed.)**    **Important Disclaimer:** I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice.

"I feel like I might harm myself",ESCALATE,RETRIEVE_GUIDELINE,False,"Okay  thank you for sharing that you're feeling like you might harm yourself. That takes a lot of courage  and I want you to know I hear you  and I'm here to support you. It sounds incredibly painful to be experiencing those feelings.   First  I want to be clear: **If you are having thoughts of harming yourself  please reach out to a crisis hotline or emergency services immediately.**  You can call 988 in the US and Canada  or dial 111 in the UK. These services are available 24/7  free  and confidential.  Connecting with them can provide immediate support.   Now  because you mentioned feeling like you're carrying the weight of everything  and I understand you've been experiencing chronic guilt  let's gently explore that a bit. It sounds like you're carrying a lot of responsibility  even for things you can't control.   I'd like to try something called a "Responsibility Pie Chart." This is a way to break down the different things you feel responsible for  to see if we can identify if any of those things are disproportionately weighing on you.   **Let's start with this:** What are some of the things you feel responsible for in your life right now? Don't worry about getting them in the "right" order. Just list as many as come to mind. Think about big things and small things – things you’ve done  things that happened  things you *wish* you had done differently.   Once you've listed them  we can try to assign a percentage to each one.  This isn't about assigning blame  but rather about understanding the *weight* of each responsibility in your mind.  For example  you might say "I feel responsible for my friend's bad breakup – 30% " or "I feel responsible for my own mistakes – 50% " or "I feel responsible for keeping my house tidy – 10%."    Even if it feels overwhelming  just taking the time to even start thinking about this can be helpful.  We don’t have to do this perfectly  just take it one step at a time.   **Remember  you are not responsible for everything  and feeling guilt about things you can't control is a sign of distress.  I'm here to help you process this.  Take your time.**    "
"I can't breathe and my throat is swelling",ESCALATE,RETRIEVE_GUIDELINE,False,"Okay  I hear you. It sounds incredibly frightening to feel like you can't breathe and have your throat swelling. That's a really intense feeling. I want you to know you're not alone  and you are safe right now.  Let's try something called the 5-4-3-2-1 Grounding technique. It can help bring you back to the present moment when you're feeling overwhelmed.   First  **5 things you can see.** Look around you. Notice five things in your environment. It could be anything – a lamp  a plant  a picture on the wall  a piece of clothing  anything at all. Just focus on noticing them.  Okay  now **4 things you can touch.** Reach out and feel four things around you. Maybe the fabric of your clothes  the texture of a chair  the coolness of your skin  or the smoothness of a surface.  Really focus on the sensations.  Next  **3 things you can hear.** Listen carefully. Can you hear any sounds? Maybe the hum of a refrigerator  birds chirping outside  the sound of your own breathing  or something else. Just focus on the sounds around you.  Now  **2 things you can smell.**  Think about two things you can smell. It could be something you're currently smelling  or something you associate with calm – like coffee  fresh laundry  or a flower.  And finally  **1 thing you can taste.** What do you taste right now? It might be something you've eaten recently  or just the taste in your mouth.  Just focus on that single sensation.  Take your time with each one. Just notice.  How are you feeling as you do this?  Remember  this is just a tool to help ground you in the present.  I'm here to listen if you want to talk more about what you're experiencing.    "
