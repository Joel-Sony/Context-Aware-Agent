Even if it doesn't feel like it's helping, it can help calm your nervous system.\n*   **Try to find a quiet space** if possible.\n*   **Focus on something else.**  Try counting backwards from 100, or focusing on a simple object in the room.\n\n**I understand this is incredibly distressing.**  It\u2019s okay to feel scared and anxious.

It sounds incredibly overwhelming right now \u2013 that feeling of not being able to breathe and your heart racing is really intense, and it's completely understandable that you feel like something terrible is going to happen.  You're going through a really difficult experience, and I want you to know you're not alone.\n\nLet's take a moment to focus on the present. I'm here with you.  We're going to try a little grounding exercise to help bring you back to feeling more centered.  It's called the 5-4-3-2-1 Grounding Technique.  It can help to anchor you in the here and now.\n\nReady to try it?\n\n**5: See.**  Can you look around you and notice **five things you can see**?  It doesn't have to be anything special, just notice them. Maybe it's a lamp, a picture, a color on the wall, anything at all.\n\n**4: Touch.** Now, can you **touch four things around you**?  Notice the texture \u2013 is it smooth, rough, soft, hard?  Just focus on the feeling of those textures under your fingertips.\n\n**3: Hear.**  Can you **hear three things**?  Maybe it's the hum of the refrigerator, a bird singing, or your own breathing.  Just notice the sounds around you.\n\n**2: Smell.**  Can you **smell two things**? This might be trickier. Maybe you can smell something you've recently used, like soap, or maybe just notice any scents in the air.\n\n**1: Taste.**  Finally, can you **taste one thing**?  Maybe you can taste your own saliva, or notice the lingering taste of something you had earlier.\n\n\n\nTake your time with each step.  Just focus on noticing each sensation.  Let me know when you've done each one, or if you need a moment.  We'll do this together.\n\n\n\n"

Notice the texture \u2013 is it smooth, rough, soft, hard?  Just focus on the feeling of those textures under your fingertips.\n\n**3: Hear.**  Can you **hear three things**?  Maybe it's the hum of the refrigerator, a bird singing, or your own breathing.  Just notice the sounds around you.\n\n**2: Smell.**  Can you **smell two things**? This might be trickier. Maybe you can smell something you've recently used, like soap, or maybe just notice any scents in the air.\n\n**1: Taste.**  Finally, can you **taste one thing**?  Maybe you can taste your own saliva, or notice the lingering taste of something you had earlier.\n\n\n\nTake your time with each step.  Just focus on noticing each sensation.  Let me know when you've done each one, or if you need a moment.  We'll do this together.\n\n\n\n",
